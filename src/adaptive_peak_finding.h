 * @brief Defines the noise tolerance level for validating edge case climbing peaks.
 *
 * This constant represents the threshold for noise tolerance used in determining whether a peak 
 * is still climbing at the end of a dataset. It is used in the context of peak analysis to 
 * distinguish between genuine rising peaks and minor fluctuations that could be attributed 
 * to noise. A lower value indicates stricter criteria for a peak to be considered as climbing.

/*!
 * @brief Defines the threshold for identifying edge case peaks in a dataset.
 *
 * This constant sets the threshold for defining edge case peaks. An edge case peak is 
 * identified when the peak is near the end of the dataset and has not reached its maximum 
 * (climax) within the dataset's interval. This threshold value determines how close to the 
 * end of the dataset a peak must be to be considered an edge case. It is used to decide 
 * whether to check if a peak is still climbing or if it may continue in a subsequent dataset.
