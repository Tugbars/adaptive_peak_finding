 * Adaptive Peak Finding and Analysis Implementation.

 * Company: Aminic Aps
 *
 * This implementation provides algorithms for detecting and analyzing peaks in noisy signals.
 * The approach is based on adaptive peak detection, which dynamically adjusts detection thresholds
 * and criteria based on local signal properties, such as mean and standard deviation.
 *
 * The algorithms in this implementation utilize local mean and local standard deviation to find peaks that adhere
 * to the overall trend of the dataset in a given window. The implementation considers both the full width at half
 * maximum (FWHM) and the width at 10% of the peak height, ensuring robust peak detection and analysis.

  * @brief Determines if a peak is still climbing at the end of a dataset.
  *
  * This function assesses whether the identified peak in a dataset is still rising
  * as it reaches the end of the dataset. This is important in peak finding algorithms,
  * particularly when analyzing segments of data where the peak might extend beyond
  * the current dataset's boundary.
  *
  * The function iterates from the peak index to the end of the dataset, calculating
  * the derivative (rate of change) at each point. It checks if this derivative is
  * less than or equal to a specified noise tolerance. If the condition fails more than once,
  * it indicates that the peak is no longer climbing.
  *
  * This check helps to determine if the current dataset's peak is part of a larger peak
  * that might be fully realized in subsequent datasets. If the peak is still climbing
  * at the end of the current dataset, there may be a need to analyze the next dataset
  * to find the true peak.
  *
  * @param b The array of data points (MqsRawDataPoint_t) containing the peak.
  * @param sizeB The size of the array.
  * @param peakIndex The index of the peak within the array.
  * @param noiseTolerance The tolerance level for the derivative to be considered noise.
  * @return True if the peak is still climbing; false otherwise.
